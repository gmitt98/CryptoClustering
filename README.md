# CryptoClustering

This is the clustering homework repo.
The notebook containing the work is: Crypto_Clustering.ipynb
The data used are in the Resources folder.

Libraries used:
- Pandas
- hvplot
- SciKitLearn

We scale data and use k-means models to generate the clusters.
We also do a principal component analysis and generate new clusters then compare to the original results.
